# Hex_busters
A take on the classic quiz show using object orientated programming
Currently having problems. I can detect the "Start Button Object"
But despite finding the rectangle of the rendered font object and displaying the mose cursor coordinates.
I can't seem to dtect the collide point of the mouse to return the hex it has found.
GrrrrArghhh

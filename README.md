# Hex_busters
A take on the classic quiz show using object orientated programming
Currently having problems. I can detect the "Start Button Object"
But despite finding the rectangle of the rendered font object and displaying the mose cursor coordinates.
I can't seem to dtect the collide point of the mouse to return the hex it has found.
GrrrrArghhh

HexDemo3 and a bit of re-hasing in the hex module file has resolved the problems so I can now retrive the letter inside the hex as it collides with the mouse. Tomorrow i use that information to retrieve a question from an extrenal csv file.... well, one can hope.
